%ADAMS_PC5  approximate the solution of the initial value problem
%
%                       x'(t) = RHS( t, x ),    x(t0) = x0
%
%           using the Adams fifth-order predictor / corrector scheme
%           - this routine will work for a system of first-order 
%           equations as well as for a single equation
%
%           the classical fifth-order Runge-Kutta method is used to 
%           initialize the predictor / corrector scheme
%
%
%     calling sequences:
%             [wi, ti] = adams_pc5 ( RHS, t0, x0, tf, N )
%             adams_pc5 ( RHS, t0, x0, tf, N )
%
%     inputs:
%             RHS     string containing name of m-file defining the 
%                     right-hand side of the differential equation;  the
%                     m-file must take two inputs - first, the value of
%                     the independent variable; second, the value of the
%                     dependent variable
%             t0      initial value of the independent variable
%             x0      initial value of the dependent variable(s)
%                     if solving a system of equations, this should be a 
%                     row vector containing all initial values
%             tf      final value of the independent variable
%             N       number of uniformly sized time steps to be taken to
%                     advance the solution from t = t0 to t = tf
%
%     output:
%             wi      vector / matrix containing values of the approximate 
%                     solution to the differential equation
%             ti      vector containing the values of the independent 
%                     variable at which an approximate solution has been
%                     obtained
